* Above graph on the right shows the time variation of the component element of the rotation matrices. Their values do not get damped as the integration performed is numerical with exponential mapping scheme.
* This succeeds to keep the determinant magnitude of the rotation matrix to be 1 at all times as evident in the graph on the right.
